## **Security and Compliance in ETL/ELT**

---

### **Overview**

ETL/ELT pipelines often handle sensitive and critical data across different stagesâ€”**extraction, transformation, and loading**. Ensuring **data security** and **compliance** with regulatory standards is vital to protect privacy, maintain trust, and avoid legal penalties.

## **Key Security Areas**

| Area                    | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Encryption**     | Protects data in transit and at rest using encryption protocols                     |
| **Access Control**      | Restricts access to authorized users via roles, policies, and authentication        |
| **Audit Trails**        | Records all user activities and data movement for accountability                    |
| **Data Masking**        | Obscures sensitive information during processing                                    |
| **Tokenization**        | Replaces sensitive data with tokens to reduce exposure                              |
| **Secure Transport**    | Ensures all communication (e.g., API, JDBC) uses HTTPS, TLS, or VPN                 |
| **Secrets Management**  | Safely stores credentials and API keys (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) |
| **Anomaly Detection**   | Identifies unusual access or behavior patterns in the pipeline                      |
| **Intrusion Detection** | Monitors for unauthorized access attempts or data breaches                          |

## **Common Security Practices in ETL/ELT**

| Practice                                | Purpose                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** | Grants only necessary access to users, jobs, and systems      |
| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**    | Enforces permissions based on job functions                   |
| **Environment Isolation**               | Separates dev/test/prod environments with access boundaries   |
| **End-to-End Encryption**               | Encrypts data at source, during transport, and at rest        |
| **Secure Logging and Monitoring**       | Collects logs without leaking PII or credentials              |
| **Data Validation and Sanitization**    | Prevents injection and malicious input during transformation  |
| **Immutable Infrastructure**            | Reduces attack surface with read-only or containerized setups |

## **Compliance Considerations**

| Regulation            | Scope                                                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GDPR (EU)**         | Requires user consent, right to erasure, and data portability               |
| **HIPAA (USA)**       | Applies to health data; mandates encryption and access logs                 |
| **CCPA (California)** | Grants consumers rights to data access and deletion                         |
| **SOX (USA)**         | Requires accurate financial reporting and audit trails                      |
| **PCI DSS**           | Applies to credit card data; enforces strong encryption and access controls |
| **ISO/IEC 27001**     | Global standard for information security management                         |
| **FedRAMP**           | U.S. government cloud provider compliance framework                         |

## **Compliance Practices in ETL/ELT**

| Practice                           | Goal                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Classification**            | Tags and handles data based on sensitivity (e.g., PII, PHI) |
| **Consent and Purpose Tracking**   | Ensures data is processed legally and transparently         |
| **Retention and Expiry Policies**  | Automatically deletes data after legal timeframes           |
| **Change Management**              | Documents and controls modifications to pipelines           |
| **Audit Readiness**                | Keeps logs and policies for regulatory inspections          |
| **Cross-border Transfer Handling** | Ensures data location complies with sovereignty laws        |

## **Secure Architecture Recommendations**

* Use **VPCs** and **private subnets** for pipeline infrastructure
* Place **data encryption keys (DEKs)** under **Key Management Services (KMS)**
* Separate **sensitive transformations** into isolated services
* Monitor data lineage for visibility and compliance
