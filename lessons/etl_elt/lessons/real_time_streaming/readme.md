## **Real-time and Streaming ETL/ELT**

---

### **Definition**

**Real-time ETL/ELT** refers to the continuous processing of data as it is generated, rather than in scheduled batches. It allows for near-instantaneous ingestion, transformation, and loading of data to storage or analytics systems.

**Streaming ETL/ELT** involves processing data in motion from event sources such as logs, sensors, or applications using stream processing engines.

## **Core Characteristics**

| Feature                   | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low Latency**           | Delivers data with minimal delay (milliseconds to seconds)    |
| **Event-Driven**          | Processes each event or record individually                   |
| **Continuous Processing** | Data is processed as it flows, not in scheduled batches       |
| **Scalability**           | Must handle variable or bursty data rates                     |
| **Fault Tolerance**       | Must recover gracefully from failure with guaranteed delivery |

## **Key Components**

| Component                    | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ingestion Layer**          | Captures data in real-time (Kafka, Kinesis, Flume)                                     |
| **Stream Processing Engine** | Applies transformations, aggregations (Spark Structured Streaming, Flink, Apache Beam) |
| **Sink/Target**              | Where processed data is loaded (data lake, warehouse, NoSQL DB, dashboards)            |
| **Message Broker**           | Acts as a buffer between producer and consumer (Kafka, RabbitMQ)                       |
| **Schema Registry**          | Stores and enforces data schema (Confluent Schema Registry)                            |

## **Common Architectures**

### **Lambda Architecture**

* **Batch Layer:** Historical processing (Hadoop, Spark)
* **Speed Layer:** Real-time layer for low-latency data (Spark Streaming, Flink)
* **Serving Layer:** Unified output from both layers

### **Kappa Architecture**

* Only **real-time stream** processing using a single layer (e.g., Kafka + Flink)
* Ideal for systems that donâ€™t require historical reprocessing
