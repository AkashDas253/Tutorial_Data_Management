## **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**

---

### **1. What is OLAP?**

**OLAP** is a category of software tools that enables users to **analyze multidimensional data interactively** from multiple perspectives to support **decision-making** and **business intelligence**.

### **2. OLAP vs OLTP**

| Feature     | OLAP (Analytical)                 | OLTP (Transactional)               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Analysis and reporting            | Day-to-day transactions            |
| Data Type   | Historical, aggregated            | Current, detailed                  |
| Queries     | Complex, multidimensional         | Simple, fast read/write            |
| Speed       | Optimized for reads               | Optimized for inserts/updates      |
| Schema      | Star/Snowflake (denormalized)     | Normalized                         |
| Example Use | Sales trends, performance reports | ATM transactions, order processing |

### **3. OLAP Architecture**

* **Data Sources** → **ETL** → **Data Warehouse** → **OLAP Cube Engine** → **BI Tools**
* **OLAP Server** stores **pre-aggregated multidimensional cubes** for fast querying.

---

### **4. OLAP Cube**

* A **data structure** that allows **fast access** to pre-summarized multidimensional data.
* Elements:

  * **Dimensions**: Perspectives to analyze data (e.g., Time, Product, Region)
  * **Measures**: Numerical values (e.g., Sales, Revenue)
  * **Hierarchies**: Levels of aggregation (e.g., Year → Quarter → Month)

### **5. OLAP Operations**

| Operation      | Description                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Slice**      | Select a single layer of the cube (e.g., year = 2024)    |
| **Dice**       | Select a sub-cube based on multiple conditions           |
| **Drill-down** | Go to a lower level of detail (e.g., Year → Month)       |
| **Roll-up**    | Aggregate data to a higher level (e.g., Month → Quarter) |
| **Pivot**      | Rotate the cube to change perspectives (rows↔columns)    |

### **6. Types of OLAP**

| Type      | Description                                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MOLAP** | Multidimensional OLAP – stores data in multidimensional cubes             |
| **ROLAP** | Relational OLAP – stores data in relational databases, queries with joins |
| **HOLAP** | Hybrid OLAP – combines MOLAP (aggregated data) and ROLAP (detailed data)  |
| **DOLAP** | Desktop OLAP – local cubes on client machine for personal analysis        |
| **WOLAP** | Web OLAP – access OLAP functionalities over web browser                   |

---

### **7. OLAP Cube Design Considerations**

* **Grain of the data** (lowest level of detail)
* **Pre-aggregation vs on-demand aggregation**
* **Performance tuning** (indexing, partitioning)
* **Security** (row-level, column-level access)

---

### **8. Benefits of OLAP**

* Fast **query performance** on large datasets
* Enables **complex multidimensional analysis**
* Supports **time-series, trend, and forecasting**
* Powerful for **executive dashboards** and **drill-down analysis**
* Facilitates **self-service BI** for business users

---

### **9. OLAP Use Cases**

* Sales analysis (by region, product, time)
* Budget forecasting and variance analysis
* Financial reporting and profitability tracking
* Marketing campaign performance
* Inventory and supply chain management
