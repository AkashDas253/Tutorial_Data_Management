## **OLAP vs OLTP**

---

### **Definition**

| Category | OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)                      | OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose  | For complex analytical queries and business intelligence | For managing real-time transactional operations |
| Focus    | Decision support, historical data analysis               | Day-to-day business operations and transactions |

| **Query Type**       | Read-heavy                                  | Read and write-heavy                                    |
| **Data Source**      | Data warehouse, data marts                  | Operational databases                                   |
| **Data Type**        | Historical, aggregated                      | Current, detailed transactional                         |

| **Data Volume**      | Large (TBs–PBs), historical data            | Moderate (GBs–TBs), current data                        |
| **Response Time**    | Seconds to minutes (for large queries)      | Milliseconds to seconds (for transactions)              |
| **Operations**       | Slice, dice, drill-down, roll-up, pivot     | Create, read, update, delete (CRUD)                     |
| **Data Integrity**   | Not enforced as strictly                    | Strictly enforced (constraints, relationships)          |
| **Concurrency**      | Low to moderate                             | High (many simultaneous users)                          |
| **Backup Frequency** | Periodic (less frequent)                    | Frequent or real-time                                   |
