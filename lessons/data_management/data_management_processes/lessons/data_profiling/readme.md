## Data Profiling

---

### Definition

**Data Profiling** is the process of systematically analyzing data to understand its structure, content, quality, and relationships. It involves collecting statistics and metadata that help in evaluating the fitness of data for its intended purpose. Data profiling is commonly used in data quality initiatives, data integration, data warehousing, master data management, test data management (TDM), and compliance.

### Objectives

* Assess data quality, accuracy, completeness, and consistency
* Understand data structure, types, patterns, and formats
* Detect anomalies, nulls, duplicates, and inconsistencies
* Discover relationships between fields and datasets
* Identify sensitive or regulated data (e.g., PII, PHI)
* Support data migration, cleansing, masking, and analytics

### Best Practices

* Perform profiling early and regularly during data lifecycle
* Use both automated tools and manual inspection
* Combine multiple profiling types (structure + content + relationship)
* Document findings in data dictionaries and reports
* Integrate profiling into data quality and data governance frameworks
* Continuously monitor and re-profile as systems evolve
