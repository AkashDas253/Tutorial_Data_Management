## Version Control in Test Data Management (TDM)

---

### Definition

**Version Control in TDM** refers to the practice of tracking, managing, and maintaining different versions of test datasets over time. It ensures consistency, traceability, and repeatability of testing by allowing teams to revert, compare, or isolate specific versions of data used in various test cycles.

---

### Purpose

* Enable **repeatable and reliable** test execution
* Maintain **traceability** of data changes across test runs
* Support **parallel test development** across teams or features
* Facilitate **debugging** and **root cause analysis**
* Provide rollback capabilities for **data recovery** or **retesting**

### Key Capabilities

| Capability               | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Snapshot Management**  | Capture point-in-time versions of datasets                              |
| **Tagging and Labeling** | Assign identifiable tags (e.g., `v1.0-prod-copy`, `QA-sprint12`)        |
| **Rollback Support**     | Restore previous dataset versions for retesting or audit                |
| **Delta Tracking**       | Identify changes between dataset versions                               |
| **Branching/Merging**    | Maintain different dataset branches for teams, modules, or environments |
| **Audit Trail**          | Track who made changes, when, and why                                   |

### Versioning Techniques

| Technique                        | Description                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **File-Based Versioning**        | Store versions of data files (CSV, JSON, SQL dumps) in Git or versioned storage                           |
| **Database Snapshot Versioning** | Use RDBMS features to capture versioned snapshots (e.g., PostgreSQL snapshots, SQL Server restore points) |
| **Dataset Tagging in TDM Tools** | Assign metadata tags to versions in tools like Delphix or Informatica TDM                                 |
| **Cloud Backup Versioning**      | Maintain historical backups using services like AWS RDS snapshots, Azure Backup                           |

---

### Common Use Cases

* Rolling back test data after a failed test cycle
* Supporting different feature branches with separate test data sets
* Running regression tests using previously validated data versions
* Auditing and verifying data used in past releases
* Comparing the effect of schema or business rule changes on test outcomes

### Tools and Technologies

| Type                        | Examples                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **TDM Platforms**           | Delphix, Informatica TDM, CA TDM (with snapshot/version management)                  |
| **Version Control Systems** | Git (for file-based datasets), Git LFS (for large files), DVC (Data Version Control) |
| **Database-native Tools**   | PostgreSQL pg\_dump with version tags, SQL Server restore points                     |
| **Cloud-native Storage**    | AWS S3 versioning, Azure Blob snapshots                                              |

### Benefits

* Enables **data traceability** across test and release cycles
* Supports **collaborative testing** with environment-specific versions
* Reduces risk by enabling **data rollback**
* Facilitates **change impact analysis**
* Promotes **standardization and reproducibility** of tests

### Challenges

| Challenge             | Description                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Storage Overhead**  | Storing multiple full versions can consume space                                           |
| **Data Sensitivity**  | Versioning sensitive datasets requires strict access control                               |
| **Complex Merging**   | Merging datasets across branches may lead to conflicts or inconsistency                    |
| **Granular Tracking** | Difficult to manage versioning at a row or field level in large datasets                   |
| **Tool Limitations**  | Not all TDM tools offer built-in version control; may need integration or custom solutions |

### Best Practices

* Use **tags and naming conventions** to organize versions (e.g., Sprint23\_QA, UAT\_2024-06-01)
* Combine versioning with **metadata and documentation**
* Store **versioned datasets** separately from production or temp data
* Automate **snapshot creation** before major test cycles or deployments
* Use **differencing tools** to track schema and data-level changes
* Secure access to versioned datasets, especially when containing sensitive data
