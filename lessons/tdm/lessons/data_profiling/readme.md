## Data Profiling in Test Data Management (TDM)

---

### Definition

**Data Profiling** is the process of examining, analyzing, and summarizing data from existing sources to understand its structure, content, quality, patterns, and relationships. It is a foundational step in preparing data for subsetting, masking, test case generation, and ensuring data compliance in Test Data Management (TDM).

---

### Purpose

* Assess data quality, completeness, consistency, and accuracy
* Identify anomalies, duplicates, and inconsistencies
* Understand data distribution, frequency, and outliers
* Define effective masking, subsetting, and transformation rules
* Detect sensitive or compliance-relevant data (e.g., PII, PHI)
* Enable test data generation and validation
* Support downstream TDM processes and data governance

### Profiling Process

| Step                           | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Connect to Data Source**  | Access structured or semi-structured data via connectors                |
| **2. Select Data Assets**      | Choose tables, views, fields for profiling                              |
| **3. Apply Policies or Rules** | Apply pre-defined rules (e.g., for identifying PII or masking patterns) |
| **4. Perform Profiling**       | Analyze structure, content, and relationships                           |
| **5. Identify Sensitive Data** | Use pattern matching, dictionaries, or ML classifiers                   |
| **6. Validate Results**        | Review findings, tag data, and verify rule violations                   |
| **7. Generate Reports**        | Produce quality scorecards, field summaries, and insights               |
| **8. Use for TDM Operations**  | Feed results into masking, subsetting, or test generation               |

### Use in Test Data Management (TDM)

* Define subsetting rules based on value distributions and table relationships
* Drive masking policies by identifying sensitive and regulated fields
* Detect data inconsistencies and gaps before test data provisioning
* Support test case creation by identifying edge cases and data outliers
* Validate data readiness and structure before data is moved to test environments
* Enforce compliance by tagging and reporting on high-risk or regulated data

| **Real-Time Profiling Limits** | Limited applicability in streaming or frequently changing data environments |
| **False Positives**            | Over-identification of sensitive patterns may occur                         |
| **Manual Interpretation**      | Human validation is needed to confirm profiling insights and exceptions     |

### Best Practices

* Perform profiling **before** masking, subsetting, or provisioning
* Use **automated tools** for accuracy, scale, and repeatability
* Apply both **structure** and **content** profiling for complete coverage
* Run **regular profiling** to detect schema drift and data changes
* Maintain **profiling logs, reports**, and **data quality dashboards**
* Integrate profiling with **CI/CD pipelines** for data validation
