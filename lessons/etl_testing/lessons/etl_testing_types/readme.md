## **Types of ETL Testing**

ETL (**Extract, Transform, Load**) testing verifies that data is accurately and reliably extracted from source systems, transformed according to business rules, and loaded into the target system. This ensures data **quality**, **consistency**, **integrity**, **security**, and **performance** across the data pipeline.
