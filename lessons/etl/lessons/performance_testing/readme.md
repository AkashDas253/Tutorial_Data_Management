## **Performance Testing**

---

### **Overview**

**Performance Testing** evaluates the **speed, scalability, and stability** of ETL processes, data warehouse queries, and reporting systems under various workloads. It ensures the system meets expected performance criteria for timely data processing and response times.

---

### **Objectives**

* Measure **ETL job execution time** and throughput
* Test **query response times** on large data volumes
* Evaluate **system scalability** as data size grows
* Identify **bottlenecks** in ETL workflows or queries
* Ensure system **stability under peak loads**
* Validate **resource utilization** (CPU, memory, I/O) during operations

### **5. Sample Performance Testing Workflow**

1. Define **performance goals and SLAs**
2. Prepare **test environment** similar to production
3. Identify **critical ETL workflows and queries**
4. Develop **test scripts** to simulate expected loads
5. Execute tests and **monitor metrics**
6. Analyze results to find **bottlenecks**
7. Optimize queries, ETL logic, or infrastructure
8. Re-test to validate improvements

---

### **6. Best Practices**

* Use **realistic test data volumes and workloads**
* Monitor **end-to-end performance** including database and ETL layers
* Automate performance tests for **regression and continuous testing**
* Set clear **performance benchmarks and alerting thresholds**
* Collaborate with DBAs and infrastructure teams for tuning
* Document **performance baselines** for comparison over time
