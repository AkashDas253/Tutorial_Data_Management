## **Data Transformation Testing**

---

### **Overview**

**Data Transformation Testing** verifies that data transformations in the ETL process are correctly implemented and produce accurate, expected results. It ensures source data is properly converted, cleaned, enriched, and formatted before loading into the target system.

---

### **Objectives**

* Validate **correctness of all transformation rules and logic**
* Ensure **data conversions, calculations, and aggregations** are accurate
* Confirm **data cleansing (e.g., removing invalid data, formatting)** is applied properly
* Verify **business rules and mapping specifications** are implemented as intended
* Detect errors or discrepancies introduced during transformation

### **1. Common Transformation Types to Test**

| Transformation Type  | Description                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data type conversion | Converting data types (e.g., string to date, int to float) |
| Data cleansing       | Removing invalid, duplicate, or irrelevant data            |
| Data enrichment      | Adding new calculated or derived columns                   |
| Aggregations         | Summarizing data (sum, average, count)                     |
| Data mapping         | Mapping source values to target values                     |
| Lookup & Join        | Integrating data from multiple sources                     |
| Filtering            | Excluding unwanted data based on conditions                |
| Sorting & Ranking    | Ordering data by specific criteria                         |

### **2. Sample Test Scenarios**

| Test Case ID | Scenario                                                  | Expected Result                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| TC\_DT\_001  | Validate data type conversions                            | All fields have correct target data types |
| TC\_DT\_002  | Verify calculated fields (e.g., profit margin)            | Calculations match business rules         |
| TC\_DT\_003  | Check data cleansing rules (e.g., remove invalid records) | Invalid records are excluded              |
| TC\_DT\_004  | Confirm correct mapping of source to target values        | Mapping logic applied accurately          |
| TC\_DT\_005  | Validate lookup joins with reference tables               | Joined data is accurate and complete      |
| TC\_DT\_006  | Verify filters exclude unwanted data                      | Only expected records are loaded          |

### **3. Tools & Techniques**

| Tool/Method             | Usage                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| SQL Queries             | Validate transformation logic with queries         |
| ETL Tool Debugger/Logs  | Trace transformation steps and identify issues     |
| Data Profiling Tools    | Check quality and distribution of transformed data |
| Automation Scripts      | Automate verification of transformation rules      |
| Business Rule Documents | Reference for validating logic and calculations    |

---

### **4. Sample SQL Queries**

**Check data type conversion**

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'target_table';
```

**Validate calculated field**

```sql
SELECT order_id, (sales_amount - cost_amount) AS profit
FROM target_table
WHERE profit <> expected_profit; -- Compare with expected values
```

**Verify data cleansing (exclude invalid)**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM target_table
WHERE status NOT IN ('Active', 'Inactive'); -- Invalid statuses should not exist
```

**Check mapping logic**

```sql
SELECT source_code, target_code
FROM mapping_table
WHERE source_code NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT source_code FROM source_table);
```

### **5. Best Practices**

* Review and understand **business rules and mapping specifications** before testing
* Validate transformations **incrementally** during ETL development
* Use **sample data sets** with known outputs for easy verification
* Automate transformation validations to **detect regressions quickly**
* Collaborate with business analysts for **rule validation and clarifications**
* Document all transformation test cases and results for audit

### **6. Challenges**

| Challenge                    | Description                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Complex transformation logic | Difficult to validate nested or multi-step transformations |
| Large data volumes           | Testing at scale requires optimized queries and scripts    |
| Incomplete specifications    | Missing or ambiguous business rules                        |
| Data dependency              | Transformations dependent on external lookup data          |
