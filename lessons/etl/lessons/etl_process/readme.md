## **ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load)**

ETL is a data integration process that extracts data from source systems, transforms it into a suitable format, and loads it into a target system such as a data warehouse.

---

### **Objectives**

* Consolidate data from multiple sources
* Clean, standardize, and enrich data
* Prepare data for analysis and reporting
* Enable historical and centralized storage

---

## **1. Extract Phase**

### **Purpose**: Retrieve raw data from various source systems.

### **Source Types**

* Relational databases (e.g., Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
* NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)
* Flat files (CSV, XML, JSON)
* APIs and Web Services (REST, SOAP)
* ERP, CRM, and legacy systems
* Cloud storage platforms

### **Extraction Methods**

| Method                    | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full Extraction           | Retrieves all records every time                                    |
| Incremental Extraction    | Retrieves only changed data since the last load                     |
| Change Data Capture (CDC) | Detects and extracts data that has changed using logs or timestamps |

### **Key Concepts**

* Source system connectivity
* Data staging area
* Data snapshot vs live extraction
* Scheduling and frequency of extraction

## **2. Transform Phase**

### **Purpose**: Convert extracted data into a suitable format or structure.

### **Transformation Operations**

| Category                      | Sub-Operations                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Cleansing**            | Remove duplicates, handle nulls, correct types |
| **Data Standardization**      | Convert formats (e.g., date/time, units)       |
| **Data Mapping**              | Map source fields to target schema             |
| **Data Enrichment**           | Add missing data or external data              |
| **Business Rule Application** | Convert logic into consistent rules            |
| **Aggregation**               | Summarize data (e.g., totals, averages)        |
| **Joins & Merges**            | Combine data from multiple sources             |
| **Filtering & Sorting**       | Remove irrelevant data and organize            |
| **Validation**                | Ensure data meets constraints and rules        |
| **Surrogate Key Generation**  | Generate unique keys for target systems        |

### **Advanced Techniques**

* Lookup transformations
* Conditional logic
* Pivoting and unpivoting
* Normalization / Denormalization
* Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs)

  * Type 0: Retain original
  * Type 1: Overwrite
  * Type 2: Add new row
  * Type 3: Add new column
  * Type 6: Hybrid

## **3. Load Phase**

### **Purpose**: Move transformed data to the target system.

### **Target Systems**

* Data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
* Data marts
* Analytical databases
* Data lakes

### **Loading Methods**

| Method                   | Description                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Initial Load             | Full dataset loaded for the first time |
| Incremental Load         | Only changed/new data is loaded        |
| Batch Load               | Processed in scheduled intervals       |
| Real-Time/Streaming Load | Continuous, real-time data integration |

### **Load Strategies**

| Strategy          | Description                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Insert Only       | Append-only, no updates or deletions        |
| Upsert            | Insert new records and update existing ones |
| Delete and Reload | Remove old records and reload fresh data    |

### **Considerations**

* Indexing and constraints
* Error handling and retries
* Commit frequency and transaction control
* Load window and concurrency

---

## **4. Supporting Components**

### **Staging Area**

* Temporary storage for extracted raw data
* Used to decouple source and transformation

### **Metadata Management**

* Tracks source-to-target mappings
* Manages lineage, audit, and transformations

### **Logging and Auditing**

* Monitors job status, execution time, and errors
* Supports compliance and debugging

## **5. Tools and Technologies**

| Tool Type     | Examples                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ETL Platforms | Talend, Informatica, Apache Nifi, SSIS        |
| Cloud ETL     | AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory, GCP Data Fusion |
| Orchestration | Apache Airflow, Prefect, Dagster              |
