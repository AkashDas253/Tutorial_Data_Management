### **3. Which Transformation is Best?**

* **No single transformation is “best.”**

* Effective ETL pipelines use a **combination** based on:

  * Data quality needs
  * Business rules
  * Performance constraints
  * Historical tracking needs

* Typical sequence:
  **Extraction → Deduplication → Cleaning → Validation → Mapping → Derivation → Aggregation → SCD Handling → Loading**

---

### **4. Best Practices**

* Apply **deduplication** early to remove redundant records.
* Use **data cleaning** and **validation** to ensure accurate data.
* Perform **mapping** and **standardization** for consistency.
* Use **SCD handling** to maintain history as required.
* Optimize joins/lookups for performance.
* Document transformation rules for maintainability.
