## **Regression Testing**

---

### **Overview**

**Regression Testing** verifies that recent changes, fixes, or enhancements in the ETL process or data warehouse do **not adversely affect** existing functionalities and data accuracy. It ensures that previously validated data loads, transformations, and reports still work correctly after updates.

---

### **Objectives**

* Confirm **existing features continue to work as expected** after changes
* Detect **new bugs or data issues introduced by code changes**
* Validate **ETL workflows, data quality, and reports remain consistent**
* Maintain **overall system stability and reliability** during iterative development

### **1. When to Perform Regression Testing**

| Scenario                         | Description                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| After applying bug fixes         | Validate the fix and ensure no side effects            |
| After enhancement or new feature | Confirm new code does not break existing functionality |
| After environment changes        | Verify deployment did not alter system behavior        |
| After database schema changes    | Ensure data and metadata remain consistent             |
| During periodic maintenance      | Regularly check system integrity over time             |

### **2. Scope of Regression Testing**

| Area                   | What to Test                                               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ETL Jobs               | Data extraction, transformation, and load logic            |
| Data Quality           | Validations, null/default checks, duplicates, completeness |
| Reports and Dashboards | Metrics, aggregations, filters, and visualizations         |
| Metadata and Schema    | Structural consistency and constraints                     |
| Performance            | Response time after changes                                |

### **3. Types of Regression Testing**

| Type                     | Description                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Full Regression**      | Test all existing test cases/end-to-end workflows          |
| **Partial Regression**   | Test affected modules or components after changes          |
| **Selective Regression** | Test only the impacted test cases based on change analysis |
| **Automated Regression** | Use automated test scripts to speed up regression cycles   |

---

### **4. Best Practices**

* Maintain a **comprehensive regression test suite** covering critical business processes
* Automate regression tests wherever possible for efficiency and repeatability
* Prioritize test cases based on **risk and impact analysis**
* Keep test data consistent and version-controlled for reproducibility
* Schedule regression testing as part of **CI/CD pipeline** and release cycles
* Log and track all defects found during regression for future reference

---

### **5. Sample Regression Testing Workflow**

1. **Identify changes** in ETL code, schema, or reports
2. **Select impacted test cases** from regression suite
3. **Prepare test environment and data** reflecting production-like conditions
4. **Execute regression tests** (manual or automated)
5. **Compare actual vs expected results** thoroughly
6. **Report and track defects** if any found
7. **Sign off** regression testing after all issues are resolved

### **6. Challenges**

| Challenge                              | Description                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Large test suites take long to execute | Time and resource intensive without automation              |
| Keeping regression tests updated       | Changes in requirements or code may make tests obsolete     |
| Data dependency and environment issues | Flaky results if test data or environments are inconsistent |
| Balancing coverage and speed           | Selecting which tests to run for timely feedback            |
