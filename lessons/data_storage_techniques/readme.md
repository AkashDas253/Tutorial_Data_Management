## ðŸ“˜ Data Storage Techniques in Data Warehousing

---

### **Definition**

Data storage techniques in data warehousing refer to how data is **organized, stored, and optimized** within the data warehouse to support **fast querying, aggregation**, and **efficient space utilization**.

---

### **Purpose**

- Improve **query performance** and **data retrieval**  
- Optimize **storage space**  
- Enable **OLAP operations** on large datasets  
- Facilitate **partitioning, indexing, and aggregation**

---

### **Core Storage Techniques**

| Technique                | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Star Schema**           | Central fact table connected to dimension tables; simple and fast for queries |
| **Snowflake Schema**      | Normalized version of star schema; saves space but may reduce performance |
| **Galaxy Schema**         | Also known as Fact Constellation; multiple fact tables sharing dimension tables |
| **Denormalization**       | Reduces joins by storing redundant data; improves read speed |
| **Partitioning**          | Splitting large tables into smaller pieces (horizontal/vertical) for performance |
| **Indexing**              | Creating index structures to speed up access (B-tree, bitmap, etc.) |
| **Materialized Views**    | Precomputed query results stored like a table for faster access |
| **Compression**           | Reduces storage space and speeds up I/O; especially effective for columnar data |
| **Columnar Storage**      | Stores data column-wise rather than row-wise; great for analytics and compression |
| **Bitmap Indexing**       | Efficient indexing technique for low-cardinality categorical data |
| **Aggregation Tables**    | Pre-summarized data for high-level analysis; improves OLAP performance |

### **Columnar vs Row-based Storage**

| **Storage Type**     | **Description** |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Row-based Storage** | Stores data in rows (traditional RDBMS format). Better suited for **OLTP systems** where transactional consistency and speed of row retrieval are crucial. |
| **Columnar Storage**  | Stores data in columns, optimized for **analytics and OLAP operations**. Better for queries that involve aggregating or filtering large datasets over specific columns (e.g., **sales**, **revenue**, etc.). Typically used in **data warehouses**. |

| **Pros of Row-based Storage** | **Cons of Row-based Storage** |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Fast for **write operations** | Slow for **analytical queries** |
| Good for **OLTP workloads**   | Inefficient for **complex aggregations** |
| Better **for transactional systems** | Limited **compression** capabilities |

| **Pros of Columnar Storage** | **Cons of Columnar Storage** |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Fast for **analytical queries** (e.g., SUM, AVG) | Slower for **insert/update operations** |
| **Better compression** of data | Not suited for **transactional systems** |
| Optimized for **data compression** | May need to load full column for some queries |

---

### **Schema-Based Techniques**

| Schema Type     | Use Case |
|------------------|----------|
| **Star Schema**     | Simpler queries, denormalized dimensions, fast OLAP |
| **Snowflake Schema**| More normalized, saves space, better for complex hierarchies |
| **Galaxy Schema**   | Complex systems with multiple business processes |

---

### **Partitioning**

**Partitioning** involves splitting large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces based on certain criteria to improve query performance.

| **Partitioning Type**       | **Description** |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| **Horizontal Partitioning**  | Splits data by rows based on certain criteria (e.g., by range like date, or hash-based) |
| **Vertical Partitioning**    | Divides a table by columns (e.g., splitting wide tables with many columns into narrower ones) |
| **Range Partitioning**       | Divides data into partitions based on a range of values (e.g., partitioning by year or month) |
| **List Partitioning**        | Splits data into partitions based on a list of values (e.g., separating data by region or department) |
| **Hash Partitioning**        | Divides data based on a hash function for more even distribution across partitions |

**Advantages of Partitioning**:
- Improved **query performance** (especially for large datasets)  
- Better **maintenance** and **management** of large datasets  
- Faster data retrieval by accessing only relevant partitions

---

### **Indexing Techniques**

| Type            | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **B-tree Index**   | Balanced tree structure for quick search |
| **Bitmap Index**   | Ideal for attributes with few distinct values |
| **Composite Index**| Index on multiple columns |

---

### **Data Compression**

Data compression reduces the size of stored data, improving both storage efficiency and query performance (by reducing I/O operations).

| **Compression Technique**    | **Description** |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| **Dictionary Encoding**      | Replaces repeated values with shorter codes, particularly effective for categorical data. |
| **Run-Length Encoding**      | Stores repeated values as a single value with a count, effective for repeating patterns in data. |
| **Delta Encoding**           | Stores the difference between consecutive values (useful for **time-series data**). |
| **Byte/Bit-Packing**         | Efficiently packs data into fewer bytes or bits for better space utilization. |

**Advantages of Compression**:
- **Reduces storage space** significantly  
- **Improves I/O performance** due to smaller data transfers  
- Effective for **columnar storage** formats (e.g., Parquet, ORC)

**Challenges**:
- Additional **CPU overhead** for compression and decompression  
- Complexity in managing **compression levels** for performance vs space trade-offs

### **Archiving**

**Archiving** refers to the process of storing historical or infrequently accessed data in a separate storage medium for **long-term retention**.

| **Archiving Type**          | **Description** |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| **Cold Storage**             | Stores data that is infrequently accessed (e.g., tapes, cloud-based cold storage). |
| **Data Lakes**               | Stores raw, unstructured data for long-term retention, useful for historical analytics. |
| **Backup and Restore**       | Regular backups of critical data in case of disaster recovery, often with periodic archiving of historical data. |

**Benefits of Archiving**:
- Reduces storage costs for active data (by moving old data to cheaper storage)  
- Improves **performance** of the data warehouse by keeping only relevant data in active storage  
- Enhances **data retention** and regulatory compliance for long-term data storage

**Challenges**:
- Ensuring **data accessibility** when needed (especially with cold storage)  
- Managing **archival retention policies**  
- Handling **data retrieval latency** from archived storage

### **Materialized Views**

- Stored query results  
- Automatically or manually refreshed  
- Improves performance of **complex joins/aggregations**

---

### **Advantages of Efficient Storage**

- Reduces query latency  
- Optimizes disk space and I/O operations  
- Improves user experience in BI tools  
- Scales better with large data volumes

---

### **Challenges**

- Designing optimal schemas and indexes  
- Managing storage overhead for pre-aggregated data  
- Balancing space vs performance (especially with materialized views)
