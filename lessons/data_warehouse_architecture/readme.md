## **Data Warehouse Architecture**

---

### **1. What is Data Warehouse Architecture?**

Data warehouse architecture defines the **logical and physical layout** of the entire data warehouse system, covering **data sources**, **storage**, **processing**, and **access mechanisms**.

---

### **2. Common Architectural Layers**

| Layer                       | Purpose                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Source Layer**       | Origin of data (OLTP systems, flat files, APIs, etc.)         |
| **Data Staging Layer**      | ETL operations â€“ data extraction, transformation, and loading |
| **Data Storage Layer**      | Centralized data warehouse repository (schemas, cubes, marts) |
| **Data Presentation Layer** | Provides data access to end-users and reporting tools         |
| **Metadata Layer**          | Stores data definitions, mappings, and lineage                |
| **Management Layer**        | Handles job scheduling, monitoring, logging, security         |

### **3. Types of Data Warehouse Architectures**

#### **A. Single-Tier Architecture**

| Feature    | Description                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Structure  | Data source directly connects to reporting layer            |
| Use Case   | Small-scale or experimental setups                          |
| Limitation | No separation of concerns, poor scalability and performance |

---

#### **B. Two-Tier Architecture**

| Feature    | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Structure  | Staging and storage layers separate from presentation layer  |
| Advantage  | Slightly better scalability and flexibility                  |
| Limitation | Still tightly coupled; may not support high concurrency well |

---

#### **C. Three-Tier Architecture (Standard)**

| Layer           | Function                                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bottom Tier** | Data sources + staging area + ETL process          |
| **Middle Tier** | Data warehouse storage (fact and dimension tables) |
| **Top Tier**    | OLAP tools, dashboards, ad hoc query interfaces    |

Most common and scalable architecture used in enterprise systems.

### **4. Detailed Components**

#### **A. Data Source Layer**

* Operational databases
* Legacy systems
* External feeds (web services, APIs)
* Logs and flat files

#### **B. ETL Layer (Data Staging Area)**

* Cleanses, filters, transforms, and loads data
* Handles data quality, deduplication, SCD handling
* Tools: Informatica, Talend, Apache NiFi, AWS Glue

#### **C. Data Storage Layer**

* Central warehouse database (star/snowflake schema)
* Stores historical, integrated, and subject-oriented data
* May include:

  * **Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW)**
  * **Operational Data Store (ODS)**
  * **Data Marts**

#### **D. OLAP and Presentation Layer**

* Cubes and aggregate tables for multi-dimensional analysis
* Tools: Power BI, Tableau, Looker, MicroStrategy

#### **E. Metadata Layer**

* Technical Metadata: schema, transformations, source mappings
* Business Metadata: definitions, rules, glossary

#### **F. Management & Security Layer**

* Job orchestration, error handling, logging
* User access control, encryption, auditing

---

### **5. Extended Architectures**

#### **A. Federated Architecture**

* Combines data from multiple warehouses or marts
* Supports decentralized or hybrid data ownership

#### **B. Cloud-Based Architecture**

* Warehouses hosted on platforms like Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Azure Synapse
* Features: auto-scaling, serverless, pay-as-you-go, easier maintenance

#### **C. Lambda Architecture**

| Layer             | Role                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Batch Layer**   | Processes historical data            |
| **Speed Layer**   | Processes real-time streaming data   |
| **Serving Layer** | Combines and provides unified access |

---

### **6. Modern Enhancements**

| Enhancement                | Description                                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Lake Integration**  | Raw data stored in low-cost storage before transformation       |
| **Lakehouse Architecture** | Merges features of data lakes and warehouses (e.g., Delta Lake) |
| **Streaming ETL**          | Real-time ingestion and transformation (e.g., Kafka, Spark)     |
| **Serverless DW**          | Cloud platforms auto-manage infrastructure (e.g., Snowflake)    |

---

### **7. Benefits**

* Scalable and centralized analytics
* Historical and consolidated data
* Enhanced business intelligence capabilities
* Support for structured and semi-structured data
* Data quality and consistency across departments

---

### **8. Challenges**

* Complex setup and integration
* High initial cost
* Latency for real-time analytics (in batch architectures)
* Data governance and security risks if not managed properly
