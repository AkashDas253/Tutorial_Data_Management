## **Data Warehousing Fundamentals**

---

### **1. What is a Data Warehouse (DW)?**

A **Data Warehouse** is a **centralized, integrated repository** designed for **storing, querying, and analyzing** large volumes of **historical and current data** from multiple sources to support decision-making.

### **2. Key Characteristics**

| Characteristic       | Description                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Subject-Oriented** | Organized around key business areas (e.g., sales, finance) |
| **Integrated**       | Combines data from various sources in a unified format     |
| **Time-Variant**     | Stores historical data for trend analysis                  |
| **Non-Volatile**     | Data is stable and not frequently changed or deleted       |

### **3. Differences from OLTP Systems**

| Feature       | OLTP (Operational)     | OLAP / DW (Analytical)        |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Focus         | Transaction processing | Historical data analysis      |
| Data Volume   | Low to moderate        | Very large                    |
| Query Type    | Short, routine (CRUD)  | Complex, ad-hoc               |
| Normalization | Highly normalized      | Denormalized (star/snowflake) |
| Users         | Front-line staff       | Business analysts, management |

### **4. Core Components of a Data Warehouse**

| Component                | Description                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Sources**         | OLTP systems, external feeds, IoT, APIs           |
| **ETL Process**          | Extract, Transform, Load operations               |
| **Staging Area**         | Temporary storage for raw data pre-transformation |
| **Data Warehouse DB**    | Central storage (structured, subject-oriented)    |
| **Data Marts**           | Subsets of the DW for specific departments        |
| **Metadata Repository**  | Stores data definitions, lineage, rules           |
| **BI & Analytics Tools** | Dashboards, reports, and query interfaces         |

### **5. Common Architectures**

| Architecture Type  | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Two-tier**       | Direct connection between client and DW        |
| **Three-tier**     | Includes presentation, logic, and data layers  |
| **Hub-and-Spoke**  | Central DW with dependent data marts           |
| **Data Lake + DW** | Raw data storage + structured DW for analytics |

---

### **6. Popular Design Approaches**

| Approach                | Description                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Top-Down (Inmon)**    | Start with enterprise DW → build data marts |
| **Bottom-Up (Kimball)** | Start with data marts → integrate into DW   |
| **Hybrid**              | Combine both approaches                     |
