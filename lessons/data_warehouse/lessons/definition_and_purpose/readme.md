## üìò Data Warehousing: Definition & Purpose 

---

### üßæ Definition

A **Data Warehouse (DW)** is a **centralized, integrated repository** designed to support **analytical processing**, **business intelligence (BI)**, and **decision-making** by storing large volumes of **historical and current data** collected from diverse sources. It follows the principle of **subject orientation**, **time variance**, **non-volatility**, and **integration**.

> It is **optimized for read-heavy operations**, enabling fast querying, slicing, dicing, and trend analysis over vast datasets.
