## **Flat Schema**

---

### **1. Definition**

A **Flat Schema** is the simplest form of data organization where **all data is stored in a single table** without any separation into fact and dimension tables. It combines descriptive and transactional data in one wide table.

---

### **2. Characteristics**

* Single table containing both **measures** (facts) and **descriptive attributes** (dimensions)
* No explicit relationships or foreign keys between tables because only one table exists
* No normalization or denormalization applied since no table splitting occurs
* Simple structure, resembling a spreadsheet or flat file

---

### **3. Advantages**

* **Simple to design and understand** due to lack of complex relationships
* **No joins required** in queries, which can simplify query writing and potentially improve read performance for small datasets
* Easy to load and maintain for small, simple datasets

---

### **4. Disadvantages**

* **Poor scalability:** The table can become very large and inefficient for querying as data grows
* **Data redundancy:** Repeated dimension data increases storage needs and causes maintenance issues
* **Limited flexibility:** Difficult to extend or modify schema without affecting all data
* **Performance bottlenecks** for complex queries on large datasets, due to lack of indexing and normalization
* **No support for slowly changing dimensions (SCDs)** or complex analytical operations

---

### **5. Use Cases**

* Small or temporary datasets where simplicity is more important than scalability
* Prototyping or quick analysis without full warehouse design
* Export or report files where data is flattened for easy consumption by other systems

### **6. Comparison with Other Schemas**

| Feature          | Flat Schema       | Star Schema                            | Snowflake Schema                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Table Structure  | Single wide table | One fact + multiple dimension tables   | Normalized dimension tables              |
| Data Redundancy  | High              | Moderate                               | Low                                      |
| Query Complexity | Low (no joins)    | Moderate (joins with dimension tables) | Higher (more joins due to normalization) |
| Scalability      | Poor              | Good                                   | Better than star in storage efficiency   |
| Flexibility      | Low               | High                                   | High                                     |

### **7. Example**

| Sale\_ID | Sale\_Date | Customer\_Name | Product\_Name | Quantity | Price | Region |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------- | ----- | ------ |
| 1001     | 2025-06-01 | John Doe       | Widget A      | 5        | 20.00 | East   |
| 1002     | 2025-06-01 | Jane Smith     | Widget B      | 3        | 15.00 | West   |
| 1003     | 2025-06-02 | John Doe       | Widget A      | 2        | 20.00 | East   |

* Here, customer info and product info are repeated in every row.
* No separate customer or product dimension tables.
* Simple and fast to query but redundancy grows as data grows.

---

### **8. Summary**

A flat schema is a straightforward, simple data organization approach best suited for small datasets or quick, simple analyses. However, for larger, more complex data warehousing needs, more structured schemas like star or snowflake are preferred for performance, maintainability, and flexibility.
