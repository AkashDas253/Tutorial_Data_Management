## **Data Integration**

Data Integration refers to the process of combining data from multiple disparate sources into a unified view to support analytics, reporting, or operational activities.

---

### **Objectives**

* Consolidate data from various systems
* Ensure consistent and accurate data for decision-making
* Enable centralized data access and control
* Support business intelligence and data warehousing

---

### **Types of Data Integration**

| Type                          | Description                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manual Integration            | Hand-coded scripts or queries to pull and combine data      |
| Middleware Integration        | Using middleware software for communication between systems |
| Application-Based Integration | Apps or APIs perform integration at the software layer      |
| Uniform Access Integration    | Provides a unified interface but data remains at the source |
| Common Storage Integration    | Data is physically moved and stored in a central location   |

---

### **Data Sources**

* **Relational databases** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
* **NoSQL databases** (MongoDB, Cassandra)
* **Flat files** (CSV, JSON, XML)
* **APIs and Web services** (REST, SOAP)
* **Cloud platforms** (AWS S3, Azure Blob, GCP Storage)
* **ERP/CRM systems** (Salesforce, SAP)

---

### **Data Targets**

* Data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery)
* Data lakes (e.g., Hadoop, S3, ADLS)
* Operational data stores (ODS)
* Master data hubs
* Analytical dashboards

### **Integration Approaches**

| Approach                                 | Description                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)           | Extract data, transform externally, then load into target |
| ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)           | Extract data, load to target, transform within the target |
| EII (Enterprise Information Integration) | Real-time federated query system                          |
| Data Virtualization                      | Unified access without moving data                        |
| CDC (Change Data Capture)                | Sync changes in near real-time                            |

### **Key Processes**

* **Data extraction**: Pulling data from source systems
* **Data transformation**: Conforming data formats, types, and meanings
* **Data loading**: Writing transformed data to target systems
* **Metadata management**: Managing data about the data
* **Data quality management**: Ensuring accuracy, completeness, and consistency

---

### **Common Techniques**

* Data cleansing
* Data mapping
* Schema mapping
* Deduplication
* Key generation (e.g., surrogate keys)
* Timestamp synchronization

### **Tools and Platforms**

| Category              | Tools                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ETL/ELT Tools         | Talend, Informatica, Apache Nifi, SSIS, dbt   |
| Integration Platforms | MuleSoft, Dell Boomi, SnapLogic               |
| Cloud Integration     | AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory, GCP Data Fusion |
| Orchestration         | Apache Airflow, Prefect, Dagster              |

### **Challenges**

* Schema mismatches
* Data silos
* Inconsistent data quality
* Scalability and performance
* Security and compliance
* Real-time vs batch latency

---

### **Best Practices**

* Use metadata for tracking and governance
* Automate extraction and loading
* Ensure strong data validation and cleansing
* Use centralized monitoring and logging
* Secure data in transit and at rest
* Implement change data capture for real-time needs

---

### **Use Cases**

* Enterprise data warehousing
* Business intelligence dashboards
* Customer 360-degree view
* IoT and sensor data processing
* Mergers and acquisitions data unification
