## **ELT Process – Extract, Load, Transform**

**ELT** is a modern data integration pattern that shifts the transformation step **after** loading data into the target system. It is especially suited for cloud-based or distributed data platforms that can handle transformation at scale.

### **Key Differences from ETL**

| Aspect                      | ETL                                      | ELT                                               |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Order**                   | Extract → Transform → Load               | Extract → Load → Transform                        |
| **Transformation Location** | Performed in ETL tool or external engine | Performed in target system (e.g., data warehouse) |
| **Use Case**                | Traditional on-premises systems          | Cloud-native platforms, big data systems          |
| **Performance**             | Limited by ETL engine                    | Scales with data warehouse capabilities           |
| **Latency**                 | Usually higher for large datasets        | Lower for analytics-ready warehouses              |
| **Data Staging**            | Transformed before loading               | Raw data is first loaded, then transformed        |

## **Phases of ELT**

### **1. Extract**

* Pull raw data from source systems
* No or minimal transformation
* Typically unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data
* Supports batch or streaming extraction

### **2. Load**

* Raw data is directly loaded into the **data lake** or **data warehouse**
* Load can be bulk, incremental, or real-time
* Optimized for large-scale ingestion
* Maintains raw history (auditability)

### **3. Transform**

* SQL-based or script-based transformations occur within the data warehouse
* Leverages warehouse-native compute (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
* Tools like **dbt** (data build tool) help define and manage these transformations
* Enables:

  * Joins
  * Filtering
  * Aggregations
  * SCDs (Slowly Changing Dimensions)
  * Business rule enforcement
  * Schema mapping and standardization

## **Advantages of ELT**

* **Scalability**: Leverages powerful cloud warehouse compute engines
* **Flexibility**: Raw data can be reused for multiple downstream processes
* **Faster Loading**: Minimal processing before load
* **Cost-Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-use warehouse compute for transformation
* **Modern Stack Integration**: Easily integrates with tools like dbt, Fivetran, Snowflake

## **Challenges of ELT**

| Issue                       | Description                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security and Governance** | Raw data in the warehouse must be properly governed                     |
| **Complex Transformations** | Some logic is harder to implement in SQL-only environments              |
| **Resource Consumption**    | Transformations can be compute-intensive in the warehouse               |
| **Version Control**         | Requires careful orchestration of transformation scripts                |
| **Data Quality**            | Raw data availability increases responsibility for downstream cleansing |

## **When to Use ELT**

* When using **cloud data warehouses** or **lakehouses** (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks)
* When transformation logic is **SQL-based**
* When **raw data access** is needed for experimentation or auditing
* For **modern data stack** environments with tools like dbt, Airflow, Fivetran

## **ELT vs ETL – Summary Table**

| Feature       | ETL                               | ELT                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Data Flow** | Transform before loading          | Transform after loading        |
| **Best for**  | On-prem, legacy systems           | Cloud-native, big data systems |
| **Latency**   | Higher for large data             | Lower with modern warehouses   |
| **Tooling**   | ETL platforms (Informatica, SSIS) | SQL-based (dbt, SQL scripts)   |
| **Use Cases** | Complex logic outside SQL         | Scalable analytics pipelines   |
