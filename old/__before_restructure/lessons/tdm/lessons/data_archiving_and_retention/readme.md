## Data Archiving and Retention in Test Data Management (TDM)

---

### Definition

**Data Archiving and Retention** in TDM refers to the practice of securely storing historical or inactive test datasets for future reference, compliance, audits, or reuse, and managing their lifecycle according to defined policies.

---

### Purpose

* Reduce clutter in active environments by removing obsolete data
* Retain important datasets for audit, compliance, or re-testing
* Meet regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
* Control storage costs by moving old data to lower-cost systems
* Enable recovery or rollback to specific test states when needed

### Key Components

| Component                        | Description                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Archiving**                    | Moving inactive or older datasets to long-term storage systems                 |
| **Retention Policies**           | Defining how long data should be retained and when it should be purged         |
| **Data Classification**          | Identifying critical, sensitive, or reusable data to determine retention needs |
| **Access Control**               | Restricting access to archived datasets to authorized users only               |
| **Data Retrieval**               | Mechanisms to restore archived datasets when needed                            |
| **Audit and Compliance Support** | Ensures traceability of when and why data was retained or deleted              |

### Archiving Strategies

| Strategy                   | Description                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cold Archiving**         | Move data to low-cost storage (e.g., cloud cold storage, tapes) for long-term retention |
| **Snapshot Archiving**     | Store snapshots of datasets at specific points in time (e.g., post-release, post-test)  |
| **Versioned Archiving**    | Archive datasets based on versions or release cycles for rollback or regression         |
| **Policy-Based Archiving** | Automatically archive data based on age, usage, or classification rules                 |

### Retention Policy Considerations

| Criteria                      | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Sensitivity**          | Sensitive data often has stricter retention and deletion requirements            |
| **Regulatory Compliance**     | Industry rules may dictate minimum or maximum retention periods                  |
| **Data Volume and Storage**   | Large volumes may require tiered storage to manage cost                          |
| **Test Repeatability**        | Critical datasets for regression or historical comparison may be retained longer |
| **Project or Release Cycles** | Data related to completed cycles can be archived post-release                    |

### Benefits

* **Storage Optimization**: Frees up primary storage and improves environment performance
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Supports legal and industry-mandated data retention requirements
* **Audit Readiness**: Maintains data lineage and access history for inspections
* **Controlled Data Lifecycle**: Enforces policies for automatic archival and deletion
* **Disaster Recovery**: Provides fallback options for lost or corrupted test environments

### Challenges

| Challenge                      | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access Latency**             | Archived data may take longer to retrieve, especially from cold storage            |
| **Policy Complexity**          | Balancing business, legal, and technical needs in retention policies               |
| **Data Retrieval Consistency** | Archived datasets must be restored without breaking schema or integrity            |
| **Sensitive Data Risks**       | Archives must still follow masking and access control rules                        |
| **Tool Compatibility**         | Not all systems or environments easily support archiving and retrieval integration |

---

### Best Practices

* Define **data classification tiers** (e.g., reusable, sensitive, historical)
* Establish **automated retention schedules** based on data purpose and compliance rules
* Use **encrypted and access-controlled storage** for all archived data
* Periodically **review and purge** datasets that exceed retention thresholds
* Document **archival events** (who, what, when, why) for compliance and audits
* Ensure **masking is applied before archiving** sensitive datasets
