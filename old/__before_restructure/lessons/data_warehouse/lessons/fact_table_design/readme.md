## **Steps in Designing Fact Tables**

---

### **1. Understand the Business Process**

* Identify the business process to be modeled (e.g., sales, inventory, order fulfillment).
* Understand the events or transactions that generate measurable data.

---

### **2. Define the Grain (Level of Detail)**

* Decide the lowest level of detail for each fact row.
* Example grains: per transaction, per day per product, per customer interaction.
* Grain affects data volume and query flexibility.

---

### **3. Identify the Facts (Measures)**

* List all numeric, measurable data related to the grain.
* Focus on additive or semi-additive measures for easier aggregation.
* Include derived/calculated facts if needed.

---

### **4. Identify the Dimensions**

* Determine all contextual descriptors (dimensions) linked to the facts.
* Examples: Time, Customer, Product, Location, Salesperson.
* Dimensions provide filtering and slicing capabilities.

---

### **5. Choose Fact Table Type**

* Transactional, Snapshot, Accumulating Snapshot, or Factless based on business needs.

---

### **6. Design the Fact Table Schema**

* Include foreign keys to all relevant dimension tables.
* Add fact columns (measures).
* Include surrogate keys if necessary.

---

### **7. Determine Aggregation Requirements**

* Understand typical queries to optimize aggregation strategies.
* Plan for summary tables or materialized views if needed.

---

### **8. Define Keys and Indexes**

* Use surrogate keys for dimension references.
* Define primary key for fact table if appropriate (usually composite of foreign keys).
* Create indexes to optimize query performance.

---

### **9. Plan for ETL and Data Loading**

* Define how data will be extracted, transformed, and loaded.
* Include logic to handle data quality, slowly changing dimensions, and missing data.

---

### **10. Consider Performance and Storage**

* Optimize table design for query speed and storage efficiency.
* Consider partitioning large fact tables by date or other dimension.

---

### **11. Validate and Test Design**

* Verify schema meets business requirements.
* Test with real or sample data.
* Ensure aggregations and joins return correct results.

---

### **12. Document the Fact Table Design**

* Include grain, measures, dimension keys, update frequency, and business logic.
* Maintain documentation for ongoing maintenance.
