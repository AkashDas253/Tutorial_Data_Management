## **Types of Keys in Data Warehouse**

---

### **1. Surrogate Key**

* **Definition:** System-generated unique identifier, usually an integer, used as the primary key in dimension tables.
* **Purpose:** Provides stable, immutable keys for dimensional modeling; supports Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD).
* **Characteristics:** No business meaning, auto-incremented or generated by ETL, improves join performance.
* **Use:** Primary keys in dimension tables, foreign keys in fact tables.

---

### **2. Natural Key (Business Key)**

* **Definition:** Real-world attribute(s) that uniquely identify an entity in source systems.
* **Purpose:** Used for identifying and matching records during ETL.
* **Characteristics:** Meaningful to business, may change over time, can be composite or single attribute.
* **Use:** Lookup during ETL, source system keys; generally not used as warehouse primary keys.

---

### **3. Primary Key**

* **Definition:** Key that uniquely identifies each record within a table.
* **Purpose:** Enforces uniqueness in tables.
* **In DW Context:** Usually surrogate keys in dimension tables; natural keys in source/OLTP tables.

---

### **4. Foreign Key**

* **Definition:** A key in one table that references the primary key of another table.
* **Purpose:** Maintains referential integrity.
* **In DW Context:** Dimension surrogate keys referenced by fact tables.

---

### **5. Composite Key**

* **Definition:** A key made up of two or more columns to uniquely identify a record.
* **Purpose:** Used when single column key is insufficient for uniqueness.
* **In DW Context:** Sometimes natural keys are composite; surrogate keys are preferred to avoid complexity.

---

### **6. Candidate Key**

* **Definition:** A set of columns that can uniquely identify records in a table; potential primary keys.
* **Purpose:** Basis for selecting primary keys.
* **In DW Context:** Often natural keys or combinations from source systems.

---

### **7. Alternate Key**

* **Definition:** Candidate keys that are not chosen as the primary key.
* **Purpose:** Used for unique identification but not primary.
* **In DW Context:** May be retained for lookup or data integrity purposes.

---

### **8. Junk Key**

* **Definition:** A surrogate key created to represent a combination of low-cardinality attributes (flags, indicators) grouped into a single dimension.
* **Purpose:** Reduces clutter in fact tables by consolidating unrelated small attributes.
* **Use:** Junk dimension surrogate key in fact table.

---

### **9. Degenerate Key**

* **Definition:** A key stored in the fact table that has no corresponding dimension table.
* **Purpose:** Usually represents transactional identifiers like invoice numbers.
* **Use:** Helps trace facts back to operational system transactions without extra joins.

### **Comparison Table**

| Key Type       | Description                               | Usage in Data Warehouse                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Surrogate Key  | System-generated unique ID                | Dimension PK, Fact FK                      |
| Natural Key    | Business-derived unique ID                | Source lookup, ETL mapping                 |
| Primary Key    | Unique record identifier                  | Surrogate keys in DW, natural keys in OLTP |
| Foreign Key    | Reference to primary key in another table | Fact to dimension relationships            |
| Composite Key  | Multiple columns as key                   | Rarely in DW, sometimes in source systems  |
| Candidate Key  | Potential keys for uniqueness             | Basis for key selection                    |
| Alternate Key  | Non-primary candidate keys                | Lookup or validation                       |
| Junk Key       | Consolidated low-cardinality attributes   | Junk dimension surrogate key               |
| Degenerate Key | Fact table key with no dimension          | Transaction identifiers in fact tables     |

### **Are natural and businedd key same?**

Yes, **Natural Key** and **Business Key** are generally considered the same or very closely related concepts in data warehousing and database design. Hereâ€™s a quick comparison:

| Aspect     | Natural Key                                                                   | Business Key                                                                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition | A key derived from real-world/business data that uniquely identifies a record | An attribute(s) that uniquely identifies a business entity, based on business logic |
| Origin     | Comes from actual business data (e.g., SSN, email, product code)              | Same as natural key; business-defined unique identifiers                            |
| Meaning    | Has inherent business meaning                                                 | Has inherent business meaning                                                       |
| Usage      | Used as primary key in OLTP/source systems; for record matching               | Same as natural key; used for identifying records in business processes             |
| Stability  | May change if business data changes                                           | May change if business data changes                                                 |


* Both refer to keys coming from business data, not system-generated keys.
* The terms are often used interchangeably.
* Sometimes "business key" emphasizes its role in business processes, while "natural key" stresses it is from natural (real-world) data.
