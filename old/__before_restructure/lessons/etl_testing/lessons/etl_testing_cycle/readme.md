## **ETL Testing Life Cycle**

---

### **Overview**

The **ETL Testing Life Cycle** outlines the structured phases followed to **validate data quality, accuracy, completeness, and performance** throughout the ETL process. It ensures that **data flows correctly** from source to target systems and aligns with **business and transformation rules**.
