## **Data Governance and Quality in ETL/ELT**

---

### **Definition**

* **Data Governance** is the set of policies, processes, roles, and standards that ensure the effective and responsible use of data.
* **Data Quality** is a subset of governance focused on the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability of data.

Together, they enable **trustworthy**, **compliant**, and **business-aligned** data usage.

---

## **Objectives**

* Ensure data is **secure**, **compliant**, and **fit-for-purpose**
* Define **ownership** and **accountability**
* Improve **decision-making** by enhancing data quality
* Facilitate **auditing**, **lineage**, and **stewardship**

## **Key Components of Data Governance**

| Component                             | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Stewardship**                  | Assigning people to oversee data quality, definitions, and compliance          |
| **Metadata Management**               | Managing data about data (schemas, lineage, sources, etc.)                     |
| **Data Catalog**                      | Inventory of datasets with searchable metadata                                 |
| **Master Data Management (MDM)**      | Consistent and authoritative version of key entities (e.g., customer, product) |
| **Policies and Standards**            | Naming conventions, access rules, retention periods                            |
| **Data Ownership and Accountability** | Defined roles for data creators, consumers, and custodians                     |
| **Compliance and Privacy**            | Ensuring data usage complies with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA                 |

## **Data Quality Dimensions**

| Dimension        | Description                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accuracy**     | Correctness of data (does it reflect reality?)                  |
| **Completeness** | Absence of missing values or fields                             |
| **Consistency**  | Same data across sources without contradiction                  |
| **Timeliness**   | Data is available when needed                                   |
| **Validity**     | Conformance to rules (e.g., data types, formats)                |
| **Uniqueness**   | No duplicate records                                            |
| **Integrity**    | Relationships between entities are correct (e.g., foreign keys) |

---

## **Data Quality in ETL/ELT**

### **Pre-ETL**

* Profile source data to identify quality issues
* Validate incoming data formats and types

### **During Transformation**

* Clean and standardize data (null handling, type casting)
* Apply business rules (e.g., age must be > 0)
* Deduplicate and resolve inconsistencies
* Handle missing values via imputation or exclusion

### **Post-Load Validation**

* Reconcile record counts between source and target
* Run integrity checks (e.g., orphan foreign keys)
* Compare aggregated metrics (totals, averages)

* Implement **automated data quality checks** in ETL/ELT pipelines
* Maintain **lineage tracking** to support debugging and auditability
* Enforce **access control** and **role-based permissions**
* Use **standardized metrics and dashboards** to monitor quality
* Regularly **audit and review** governance policies

| Error Rate          | Records failing quality checks      |
| Duplicate Rate      | Number of duplicate entries         |
| Rule Violation Rate | Number of business rules broken     |
| Record Latency      | Delay between source and warehouse  |
